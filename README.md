# CalculatorInPython
 A calculator make in python.

Hello, I'm here to explain this calculator!!

To get started, define your variables with sintax:<br>
    `<name>: <expression value>`

Yes, in this calculator, you can set variables.<br>
Additionally, you also can set functions, with sintax:<br>
    `fn <name>(<parametrs>) -> <expression value>`
<br><br>
If the function has more one parameter, separate each with ','.<br>
Also try make conjunts!!<br>
There are two ways to do this:<br>
    With a rule...<br>
    
   `<name>: {<variable test> | <expression rule>}`<br>
   
   or with elements list:<br>
    
   `<name>: [<elements separate by ','>]`
    
<br>
In additional, exists logic and aritmethic operations:<br>
    +: sum,<br>
    -: subtraction,<br>
    *: multiplication,<br>
    /: division,<br>
    %: rest of the division,<br>
    **: potentiation,<br>
    log <term1> <term2>: logarithm,<br>
    and: and,<br>
    or: or,<br>
    ~: not,<br>
    xor: xor,<br>
    = : equal,<br>
    <: minus,<br>
    >: bigger,<br>

Visit the code to see all operations.<br><br>

Finally, there are built-in functions:<br><br>
    sum: sum of terms (init, step, max)<br>
    abs: absolute value (value)<br>
    rad: convert value of angle to rad (value)<br>
    sin, cos and tan: respectively sine cosine and tangent (value)<br>
    invert: invert the value (value)<br>
    sqrt: calcule the square root of the value (value)<br>
    root: calcule the root (base, exponent)<br>
    sequation1: calcule the solution for the first degree equation (a,b)<br>
    sequation2: calcule the solution for the quadracti equation (a,b,c)<br>
<br>
The values of the 'pi' and 'e' were also defined.
